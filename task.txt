You are my full-stack coding assistant. Help me build a **frontend-only SaaS-style dashboard generator web app** using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Recharts**. The goal is to let users upload a clean `.csv` or `.xlsx` dataset, define what kind of dashboard they want (charts, filters, groupings), and then generate an interactive dashboard **entirely in the browser**, with multiple **export options**.
